          and its impacts on retail businesses are steep. Though 2020 has been a
          challenging year for many but at the same time it has been a boom year
          for the ecommerce industry. Here is the silver lining - people have
          not stopped shopping, they have just changed their ways of doing it.
          So, if you have been thinking about starting your online business, now
          is the perfect time to give life to that thought. <br /> <br />

          There is a cut-throat competition in the ecommerce market today but
          here is the good news - establishing an online presence for your store
          is worth the struggle. E Commerce is a pool of huge opportunities for
          anyone with internet access. <br /> <br />

          side of the world. Yes, you can sell online beyond the borders of your
          city, state, country or even continent. You can literally have a

          <h2 className="heading">1. Pick a profitable niche</h2>
          <p>
            This is perhaps the most important step. A business niche refers to
            the area of expertise in which you specialize. It includes the
            market segment and your target audience. Remember if you are
            targeting people who do not need your products, can’t afford them or
            are not interested in what you are selling, you are making things
            difficult for yourself. That's why it is important that you choose
            your niche carefully only after doing proper market research.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 className="heading">How to find a good niche?</h2>
          Offer products which are -
          <ul>
            <li>unique</li>
            <li>affordable and</li>
            <li>In-demand</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Having the right niche helps you in easy expansion of your customer
            base and amplifies your brand reach. So, there is no way you can
            ignore this crucial step.
          </p>

          <h2 className="heading">2. Find suppliers/manufacturers</h2>

          <p>
            Now that you have decided on your business niche, you need to find a
            reliable supplier for your products. The supplier is going to be the
            most important resource of your business model, so make sure you
            choose the right one. Not to forget, it can also be a time-consuming
            process, so keep some patience while finding one.
            <br /> <br />
            You can get in touch with a lot of wholesale suppliers on platforms
            like Alibaba, Indiamart, Aliexpress, etc. Once you are ready to
            commit to a suitable supplier, it’s time to get down to business and
            negotiate. When you start selling online you will realise that every
            little discount means a lot. So try to get a better deal from the
            supplier to maximise your profits.

          <h2 className="heading">3. Setting up your business</h2>

          <p>
            Now that you are ready to launch your online business, you first
            need to make it official. Yes, if you want to start selling online,
            you need to play by some rules. It’s a wise idea to get in touch
            with a C.A. or a lawyer for the best professional advice.
            <br />
            <br />
            However I would like to throw some light on principal key points you
            need to consider while setting up your business -
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Choose a <strong>unique business name</strong> (preferably the
              name should be self explanatory about the nature of business)
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>GST registration -</strong> Unless your niche is books, it
              is a mandatory requirement for all ecommerce businesses. Your
              trusted C.A. can help you do it, otherwise you can also hop on to
              websites like vakilsearch, legal pillars, etc for getting the GST
              certificate.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Trademark/business registration -</strong> Although this
              is not mandatory, yet it is advisable to get the trademark
              registration done for your business. A simple google search will
              tell you how and why you must do it.
            </li>
            <br />
          </ul>
        </div>

        <br />

        <br />

        

        <div className="point">
          <h2 className="heading">4. Choose the right platform</h2>

          <p>
            I wish I could tell you this particular online marketplace is the
            best for you but it totally depends on the nature of your business
            and your vision for the same. You need to do a bit of research
            before deciding upon which one you will use to launch your business.
            <br /> <br />
            You can either choose to sell on the giant marketplaces like amazon,
            flipkart and ebay or you may consider starting your own online store
            on platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce. It’s entirely up to you
            to decide where you want to start selling! Also remember, the
            marketplace which works for your friend might not work for you. So,
            make sure you choose the one best suitable for your business needs.

          <h2 className="heading">5. Developing marketing strategies</h2>

          <h3 className="primary-color">
            Congratulations! Your online store is live.
          </h3>

          <h3 className="primary-color">Now the race starts! </h3>

          <p>
            E Commerce is a competitive playground and you cannot just sit back
            and expect the money to roll in. It’s time to get to work.

          <p>
            You might have the most unique and the best quality product to offer
            but if you don’t pay attention to the following factors, well, you
            are already out of the race -
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Listings -</strong> a product listing is absolutely
              necessary to display the products across any online platform. It
              can make or break your business, yes it’s that important. There
              might be multiple sellers of your product out there but your
              product listing can make you unique among all of them.
            </li>
            <br />
            <br />
          </ul>

          <p>
            A little piece of advice - <strong>Never copy</strong>. Create one
            of your own!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Clear & Good quality photos -</strong> Don’t get surprised
              by what I'm going to tell you next. “People make their buying
              decisions based on photos”. Good quality product photos with clear
              attributes will keep you at the forefront of competition. Not that
              just high quality photos is all you need, you must also adhere to
              the requirements set by particular marketplaces. Violation of
              image requirements is the last thing you would want to do in your
              ecommerce business.
            </li>
            <br />

            <br />

            <li>
              <strong>Customer Reviews -</strong> Customer is the king of
              business. Getting their reviews is a very powerful strategy to
              build brand awareness, understand their perception, amplify your
              reach and strengthen the brand credibility. Request your customers
              to leave positive reviews to influence other potential customers'
              decisions.
            </li>
            <br />

            <br />

            <li>
              <strong>Promote your Business -</strong> In order to connect your
              business value to the right customer base, there is a universal
              strategy that will revolutionize your ecommerce business journey;
              and that is - organic marketing strategies like facebook ads,
              google adwords, social media presence, content marketing, etc.
            </li>
            <br />
            <br />
          </ul>

          <p>
            You should now be having a better understanding of how to run a
            successful online business. If you have the time and resources to do
